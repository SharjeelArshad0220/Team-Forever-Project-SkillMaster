Apply these learning science principles:

1. **Feynman Technique** - Each day ends with "teach back" session

2. **Pomodoro Method** - 25min study, 5min break cycles

3. **Interleaved Practice** - Mix concepts instead of blocking

4. **Deliberate Practice** - Focus on weakest areas daily

5. **Retrieval Practice** - Daily quizzes without notes

6. **Spacing Effect** - Systematic review schedule

7. **Cognitive Load Management** - Limit new concepts to 3/day
