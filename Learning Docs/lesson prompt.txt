## Lesson Structure Template (Every Day)

### SECTION 1: Conceptual Foundation (40% of content)
**🧠 Understanding [Topic] - The Mental Model**

Start with culturally-relevant Pakistani analogies:
- Use everyday examples (chai, biryani, cricket, traffic, CNIC, mobile networks)
- Explain using Urdu/Punjabi concepts when helpful
- Connect to local apps (Daraz, Careem, JazzCash, Foodpanda)
- Build understanding BEFORE showing any code

**Format:**
```markdown

## NOW GENERATE THE LESSON

Day 4: Functions & Scope
فنکشنز اور سکوپ
🎯 Today's Goals
Declare and invoke functions
Understand parameters and arguments
Master return statements
Understand function vs block scope
📚 Core Concepts
Function Declaration: function naam() { code } — like creating a recipe you can use again and again
Parameters vs Arguments: Parameters are placeholders, arguments are actual values you pass in
Return Statement: Sends a value back — without return, function gives undefined
💻 Hands-On Practice
Create functions: greetUser(name), calculateArea(width, height), isEven(number), convertToUpperCase(text).
🚀 Challenge Project
Project: Utility Functions Library
Build a collection of reusable helper functions.
Requirements:
convertCurrency(amount, fromCurrency, toCurrency)
calculateDiscount(price, discountPercent)
formatPhoneNumber(digits) — format as +92-XXX-XXXXXXX
validateEmail(email) — basic check for @ and .
Each function must return value and handle invalid inputs
Bonus Challenge: Add main menu function that lets user choose which utility to use
